# Marketplace Partner Apps

This repository contains the source code for partner apps on the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and helpful resources to build your own apps for Contentful.

## Installing an app

Head over to the [marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/) and follow the installation flow to set up any of the apps in your Contentful space.

## Adding and maintaining your app in this repo

The Marketplace Partner Apps repo is maintained as a monorepo, containing several ecosystem partner apps + the tools needed to build and maintain them. The `apps` folder contains each partner app, and each sub-folder within `apps` should contain all the code necessary to build, test, and deploy your app without references to other apps or folders.

### First time setup

The `marketplace-partner-apps` repo uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (configured in `.github/workflows/CI.yml`) to deploy itself, and [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo) (configured in `turbo.json`) to manage the collection of partner apps.

In order for your app to be deployed successfully, it must meet the following criteria:

- Have a `package.json` file with the following `scripts`:
  - `build`
    - creates a build artifact(s). `"react-scripts build"` is common for most apps without specific needs, though whatever tool or process you prefer is fine so long as it creates artifacts that can be referenced in the deploy step.
  - `test` (not necessary, but **highly** encouraged).
    - Once again `"react-scripts test"` is common for many apps and should be considered if you do not have complicated tests. Having at least basic testing and coverage will ensure your app does not deploy if breaking changes are introduced by your work or dependabot (see below).
  - `deploy`
    - All code deployed by the `marketplace-partner-apps` repo must be hosted by contentful. Your deploy job should look something like this:
      `contentful-app-scripts upload --ci --bundle-dir ./build --organization-id ${DEFINITIONS_ORG_ID} --definition-id APP_DEFINITION_ID --token ${CONTENTFUL_CMA_TOKEN}` - Make sure `--bundle-dir` points to the output of your build process (`./build` if you used `"react-scripts build"`). - `DEFINITIONS_ORG_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_CMA_TOKEN` do not need to be changed and will be appropriately filled by the build process. - The value of `APP_DEFINITION_ID` can be the id you might have used to test your deploy in you contentful space. This value can be found in the app definition after creating a custom app. **The Ecosystems Inteegrations team will update this value to a shared, official space. Please do not update it in subsequent changes/pull requests.**

> **Please note that dependabot is enabled in this repo and will run automatically.**
> While it will attempt to only upgrade dependencies without breaking changes, it is possible it will still introduce issues. Creating and maintaining comprehensive tests is critical to preventing code and build issues.

### Committing and updating your repo

When you are ready to submit your app to the [marketplace apps repo](https://github.com/contentful/marketplace-partner-apps), clone the repo locally, create a new branch with a descriptive name for the app/changes you are introducing, and create a pull-request against the `main` branch. An ecosystems integrations will review your PR soon and let you know if any changes or clarifications are needed. To ensure the fastest approval time on your PR, make sure you:

- Fill out the pull-request template as much as possible. Screenshots, images, and videos are often helpful for providing context and are encouraged.
- Comment your changes, either in GitHub or the code itself to provide reviewers more context than they might get otherwise.
- Ensure your changes are wholly contained within your app's folder, and do not make alterations to other folders or the root level. If you have need for root-level changes, please create an issue instead.
- Prevent / reduce references to external resources and code. The `marketplace-partner-apps` is intended to be open and transparent and any external resources will be _highly_ scrutinized.

## Building your own app

The best way to get started on app development is with our [create-contentful-app](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app) CLI tool.
This tool will bootstrap a brand new project with all the boilerplate code you need to start building an app.
If you are interested in learning how to build a simple example app, you can check out our [tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/apps/building-apps/).

Detailed documentation can be found in the [App SDK documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/sdk-reference/) and the [Management HTTP API reference documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/).

Please note that each app has its individual source code license associated with it. Refer to the LICENSE file in the apps root folder.
