GrowthBook and Contentful work together to enable content teams to run A/B tests without requiring developer intervention for each test.
The [Growthbook Contentful Plugin guide](https://docs.growthbook.com/guide/contentful) explains how to install and use the plugin.

There is also a [full working example app](https://github.com/growthbook/examples) that shows how to integrate Contentful and GrowthBook with Next.js.
