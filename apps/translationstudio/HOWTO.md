# How to use translationstudio

translationstudio is designed to be simple to use. Once installed and configured, you will find the extension in your sidebar and under your `App` menu entry at the top of the contentful app.

## Translate single entries using the sidebar extension

### Adding locales to your content

First of all, you need to specify which locales are available in your content object.

To do so, click on the **edit locales list** button in your sidebar and choose which languages are to be made available. This documentation assumes your will have English as your default language and German as a second language.

Finally, you can choose the appropriate translation setting from the translationstudio extension and submit the content for translation.

Depending on your translation settings, you may find additional translation options available. All AI translations will be processed immediately, but with translation management software, you may provide additional information, set a deadline and choose if this translation request is to be processed immediately or if its submission should wait until certain quota settings are met (these are configured with your translationstudio account).

That's it.

## The Dashboard

You can access the dashboard from the `App` menu.

The dashboard offers two features

1. Translating multiple entries
2. A complete translation history of your space

### Translating multiple entries

You can access your entries by selecting any of your available content types.

> [!NOTE]
> Only content types with localisable fields or those referencing a localisable content type in a reference list will be listed.

Respective entries will be loaded and you can select as much entries as you want to translate. A translation settings pane will appear on the right side of your entries list.
