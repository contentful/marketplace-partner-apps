## Why Use Content Auditor?

Over time, content platforms can become cluttered with unused assets, outdated entries, and deprecated content types, leading to increased complexity and reduced performance.

Content Auditor helps teams regain control over their content environment through actionable insights and one-click cleanup capabilities.

Key advantages include:

1. Enhanced performance through the removal of unnecessary or orphaned content.

2. Improved content governance by identifying and eliminating obsolete structures and data.

3. Streamlined content operations, ensuring only relevant, published material remains in the system.

With Content Auditor, teams can:

1. Analyze and sort unlinked content entries by content type, search large result sets, and perform one-click deletion for selected or all entries.

2. Automatically detect unused media assets, enabling easy selection and batch deletion of assets not referenced anywhere in the content model.

3. Identify unused content types with no existing entries, flagged automatically and available for safe, one-click removal.

This tool is ideal for content audits, model cleanups, or regular maintenance — enabling content teams to maintain a structured, efficient, and clutter-free workspace.
