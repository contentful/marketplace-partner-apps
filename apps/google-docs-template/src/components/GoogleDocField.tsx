/*
* Cursor AI Read: Create a Google Doc Field component that will be used to display the Google Doc in the Contentful entry editor.
* You are welcome to delete any of the copmonents below in order to make this work. Then take the client id 
* and add it to the sdk parameters.
* 
* Now for this we want to support these types in a Contentful Content Model
* - Text
* - Rich Text
* - Number
* - Date and time
* - Location
* - Boolean
* - JSON object
* 
* Then for a given Content Model that could have fields of the above types we want to be able to create or connect to the user's Google Doc.
* Then in the google doc, we want to generate a specific template based on the Content Model fields. That way when the user updates the google doc,
* the code logic can parse the google doc and update the Content Model fields with those values that the user wrote in the google doc.
* 
* So in summary there are two parts to this.
* 1. Create a template in the google doc that will be used to update the Content Model fields.
* 2. Parse the google doc and update the Content Model fields with those values that the user wrote in the google doc.
* 
* This might require an OAuth Implicit Flow to be used to get the access token for the user's Google Doc. That way the google doc can be updated and created 
* from Contentful. I'm not exactly sure how this will work so please research and figure out the best way to do this and explain it in the code.
* 
* Please first write the tests for this and then write the code. Run the tests to ensure they pass as you write the solution iteratively.
* Additionally, please write the code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain. Act like an intelligent developer, where you consider multiple
* edge cases and provide a solution that is robust and easy to understand. You also consider multiple solutions to the problem and provide the best
* solution to the problem.
