# Adapt Essentials: Asset fields

An App for making it easier to change title, description and filename of assets in bulk.

It supports in place editing for multiple locales.

![Alt text](doc/app.png)

## Why?

The common pattern for adding alt and description to the image is to upload the asset and reference
it with dedicated wrapper content type. Which makes it a bit tedious for the editors.

The lean solution is to use title and description fields of the asset itself for the alt and description image
attributes.
But you can't impose any requirements that way. So it is easy to forget to fill in the title and description fields.

This app makes it easier to go through assets and edit it in bulk.
